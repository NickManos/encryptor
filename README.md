## File Encryptor 

I made this app based off of a great tutorial at  http://tutorialzine.com/2013/11/javascript-file-encrypter/ 

Thanks to Gabe Khofri for turning me on to this tutorial.

Allows you to encrypt and decrypt files in your web browser using a passphrase. 

I got close to getting mocha and chai to work this time but ran out of time.
